# See what TraceGerm web service can offer

* **Ease of use for users**<br>
Simply create an account, choose your preffered username which will be cyphered for privacy reasons. 
Now your mobile app [TraceGerm](https://github.com/TraceGerm/TraceGermApp) will track your coordinates and store them 
through the web service.


* **Alert in case of disease outbreak**<br>
In case of an outbreak, or one of the users informed the web service that is affected with a contagious disease, 
TraceGermWS checks the tracking information of all the users and informs the ones that have been at the same place 
and time with him/her, through the TraceGerm application. This way the possibly affected people can get 
informed in time and the outbreak can be restrained. 
  
  
* **Data exportation of infection tracks**<br>
TraceGermWS is able to export data of possible infection because it constantly stores the places its users have 
visited. This way TraceGermWS can provide usefull information to centers of diseases control and prevention without 
revealing any personal information of the users as it only stores a username.
